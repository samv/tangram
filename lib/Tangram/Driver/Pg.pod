Tangram::Pg - Orthogonal Object Persistence in PostgreSQL databases

=head1 SYNOPSIS

   use Tangram;
   use Tangram::Pg;

   $schema = Tangram::Pg->schema( $hashref );

   Tangram::Pg->deploy($schema, $dbh);

      $data_source, $username, $password );

   $storage->disconnect();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is the entry point in the Pg-specific object-relational
persistence backend.

This module performs the following:

=head1 METHODS

This backend does not add any methods; for a description of
available methods, see L<Tangram::Relational>.

=head1 ERRATA

L<Tangram::Type::Dump::Storable> objects are first encoded with L<MIME::Base64>,
because Tangram does not currently have an easy mechanism for calling
C<DBI-E<gt>bind_param()> at the appropriate time to flag the column as
binary.

L<Tangram::Type::Dump::Perl> objects are stored as C<BYTEA> columns, which as
of L<DBD::Pg> 1.31, also do not get correctly escaped by the DBD
driver.  This also affects the (as-yet not fully functional)
L<Tangram::Type::Dump::YAML> back-end, which might put C<\> characters into a YAML
document.

It is recommended to use the C<storable> type with L<Tangram::Type::Dump::Any>
for this reason.
