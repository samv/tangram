Tangram::IntrSet - map Set::Object without link table

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	use Tangram;

	# or
	use Tangram::Core;
	use Tangram::IntrSet;

	$schema = Tangram::Schema->new(

		classes => { Basket => { fields => {

		iset =>
		{
			# long form
			fruits =>
			{
				class => 'Fruit',
				coll => 'basket',
			},

			# or (short form)
			fruits => 'Fruit',
		}

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class maps references to Set::Object collections in an intrusive
fashion.

The set may contain only objects of persistent classes. These classes
must have a common persistent base class.

Tangram uses a column on the element's table to store the id of the
object containing the collection.

CAUTION: the same object may not be an element of the same collection,
in two different objects. This mapping may be used only for
one-to-many relationships.

The field names are passed in a hash that associates a field name with
a field descriptor. The field descriptor may be either a hash or a
string. The hash uses the following fields:

=over 4

=item * class

=item * coll

=back

Mandatory field C<class> specifies the class of the elements.

Optional field C<coll> sets the name the column containing the id of
the containing object. This defaults to 'C_m', where 'C' is the class
of the containing object, and 'm' is the field name.

If the descriptor is a string, it is interpreted as the name of the
element's class. This is equivalent to specifying only the C<class>
field in the hash variant.
